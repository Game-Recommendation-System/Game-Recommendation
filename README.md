## Introduction

Finding a game that fits your mind is not an easy task. This game recommendation application aims to help you solve this tricky issue. It collects information of tons of game in steam, including their names, companies, release date, price, rating, description, etc, and the users can customize the filters to find the ideal game(s), and get more information about the game they are looking for.

Major **data structures** used in this project: Trie, ArrayList, HashMap, TreeMap, SortedMap, TreeSet, HashSet.

**Data** used in this project: Company.csv (12432 items), Game.csv (22465 items)

## User Interface and Featured Functions

1. Search

   * General Search

     Implemented autocomplete for search in the database. The user will be directed to the Steam game page for the game he/she searches after clicking the search button.

   * Conditional Search

     The user is able to filter based on the price, rating, and tag. Results will be displayed in the order of rating (highest on top), and if there is a tie, the second comparison will be made based off of the price. There is also a reverse order option.

2. Portfolio

   * Top Rating

     The game recommendation system will randomly choose four games (as a group) to display. Price, ratings, # of comments, platforms, and released year will be shown below a figure of the game (if there is no available figure, an error image will be the replacement).

3. Allow for multiple choice selection in conditional search.
4. Combined duplicate company/game to have a more accurate recommendation.
5. ... to be continued!
